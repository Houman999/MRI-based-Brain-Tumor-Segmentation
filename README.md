Brain tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical image analysis, aimed at identifying and delineating tumor regions from MRI scans. Accurate segmentation is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of brain tumors. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability, making automated deep learning approaches increasingly important.
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to automatically segment brain tumors using the BraTS2020 dataset. The aim is to classify and localize sub-regions such as enhancing tumor (ET), tumor core (TC), and whole tumor (WT) from multi-modal MRI scans.
